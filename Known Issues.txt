Known Issues
Every character's hitbox is out of place, this is likely a Bloodlines issues and I'm unsure how to fix it via the Pivot option.
All 3 characters that have 8 walking frames have an issue where their frame rate cannot go up, so they have the same frame rate as the 4 walking frame characters.
Legionnaire does not work properly, instead of having the walking sprites move across the screen, the sprites stay stationary based on what direction your character last moved.
It's possible that there is more issues that I haven't found yet.
